      <h2> Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <h3> Always Moving</h3>


     <p> I'm an extremely active person! I love going outdoors for hikes and playing sports. I was on the Pomona-Pitzer Women's Tennis Team during my time at Pomona, and am currently training for a marathon. I also love trying new sports (even if I'm not the best at them). I also enjoy biking in my free time. </p><br>

     <h3>Traveling</h3>
     <p> Since starting my undergrad and having my first taste of travel living across the country in California, I became addicted to seeing new places and meeting new people. While I was abroad in Australia, I <a href="https://foodandfacundo.wordpress.com/author/jianglucyy/">blogged</a> my experiences along with a few friends! I hope I'll be able to go to Africa or Europe in the near future, as I have yet to go to those continents. </p><br>

     <h3>Food and Baking</h3>
     <p>Many of friends are intense foodies, and over the past few years they have converted me. I love baking (especially bread!) and going on food adventures with friends, and trying all sorts of food. My favorite food is still my mother's homemade dumplings. Learning to cook is also one of my goals for the coming year.</p><br>

     <h3>Video Games</h3>
     <p>Ever since I was very young, I had always been enthralled by video games. Not just the concept of playing them, but also the logic and knowledge that they often require. Video games often require more critical thinking skills than people give it credit for, such as Game Theory in Pokemon that is very exciting to me. As such, I enjoy playing video games as well as analyzing the strategy behind them. One of my childhood dreams was to become a video game developer.</p><br>

     <h3>Photography</h3>
     <p> I got my DSLR my first year of college, and have taken thousands of photos since. I love photographing people and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ljiangphoto">landscapes</a>. On the rare occassion I'll be on the other side of the camera but I much more enjoy taking photos rather than being taken pictures of. One of my life dreams is to become an insta-famous photographer or one of the photographers for something like <a href= "https://www.humansofnewyork.com/">Humans of New York</a>.</p><br>

     <h3>Music</h3>
     <p>I love listening to and playing music. I grew up playing piano and violin, and briefly played flute at school for a year. Also over the years have picked up a bit of guitar and ukelele, and have tried lots of other instruments as well. Usually when I'm working, I'll be listening to music to help me get started. My favorite genre is R&B but I'm pretty open to any type of music. Currently, my favorite artist is Billie Eilish. My favorite composer is Debussy.<p><br><br>
